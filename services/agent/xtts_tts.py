"""Pipecat-compatible TTS wrapper around Coqui XTTS v2.

XTTS v2 is a multilingual (17-language) zero-shot voice-cloning TTS model
distributed via the maintained ``coqui-tts`` PyPI package. The weights
themselves are released under the Coqui Public Model License (non-
commercial) — fine for a demo, but callers shipping to paying customers
need to verify their licensing posture before enabling this engine.

Integration shape mirrors ``SileroTTSService``:

* File-at-a-time synth via ``TTS.api.TTS.tts()`` off-thread through
  ``asyncio.to_thread``. ``_stream_audio_frames_from_iterator`` chunks the
  PCM bytes into ``TTSAudioRawFrame``\\s at the negotiated 24 kHz.
* Eager model bind in ``__init__`` — Pipecat 0.0.108's ``TTSService``
  path does not call ``_load()``, so a deferred load would leave
  ``_loaded_model=None`` in prod and every synth would ErrorFrame.
* Module-level ``asyncio.Lock`` serializes ``tts()`` across instances —
  the underlying model is a torch ``nn.Module`` and is NOT thread-safe.
  Same tradeoff as Silero: one synth at a time, globally. Cloning the
  XTTS model per worker would cost ~1.8 GB of VRAM apiece.

Voice-library integration — unlike Piper/Silero which take a string
speaker id, XTTS v2 is a zero-shot voice cloner: every synth needs
reference audio (~6-30 s of the target voice) plus a language code.
This adapter reuses the ``voice_library/profiles/<profile>/`` directory
shape used by the Qwen3 sidecar so operators can swap a single reference
clip and have both engines pick it up. The voice string coming through
``build_tts_service`` is expected to be in the ``clone:<profile>`` form
(e.g. ``clone:demo-ru``); the adapter resolves that at construction
time to a concrete ``ref.wav`` path and an XTTS language code.

Barge-in trade-off — XTTS's high-level ``.tts()`` returns the entire
utterance before the first frame yields, so an ``InterruptionFrame``
arriving mid-synth cannot truncate the GPU work in progress
(``asyncio.to_thread`` is uncancellable). Same accepted MVP limitation
as Silero — see ``docs/solutions/tts-selection/silero-spike-findings.md``.
A follow-up to the low-level ``Xtts.inference_stream()`` API would give
us true streaming (first chunk ~200 ms on L4) and true interruption,
but doubles the code complexity; defer until the demo shows a real need.
